abstract = {Background
The EPKi system (Pentax, Japan) enables resolution above HDTV. Aim of the study was to test the efficacy of HD+ alone and with the new post-processing digital filter i-Scan or chromoendoscopy (Methylene blue 0.1%) in screening for colorectal cancer. We focused on lesions less than 5mm as a surrogate marker for the optical possibilities of the EPKi system.
Methods
The last 30cm of the colon in a screening population were inspected with HD+ alone, in combination with i-Scan (2:1 randomisation) and subsequently with chromoendoscopy. All lesions were characterized and targeted biopsies were performed.
Results
i-Scan augmented in 69 patients the identification of lesions from 176 to 335 (p<0.001) and chromoendoscopy to 646 (p<0.001). The additional lesions were mainly flat (type IIb, 74%), which were only recognized using i-Scan or chromoendoscopy. The amount of neoplasias was not significantly different (HD+: 5, i-Scan: 11, Chromoendoscopy: 11), but all could correctly be predicted using i-Scan or chromoendoscopy.
Conclusions
HD+ colonoscopy with and without i-Scan unmask a plethora of small lesions but chromoendoscopy can even advance the number. However, i-Scan was able to predict neoplasia as precisely as chromoendoscopy and might shortly replace chromoendoscopy as a more time efficient tool.}
