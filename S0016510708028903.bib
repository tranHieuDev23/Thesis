abstract = {Background
The diagnostic accuracy of conventional endoscopy for small colonic polyps is not satisfactory. Optimal band imaging (OBI) enhances the contrast of the mucosal surface without the use of dye.
Objective
To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy for the differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic colorectal polyps by using magnified OBI colonoscopy.
Design
An open prospective study.
Setting
Jichi Medical University, Japan.
Patients
A total of 133 colonoscopy cases.
Main Outcome Measurement
A comparative study of the overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic colorectal polyps â‰¤5 mm in size by capillary-pattern diagnosis by using conventional colonoscopy, capillary-pattern diagnosis in OBI, and pit-pattern diagnosis in chromoendoscopy with low magnification.
Results
A total of 107 polyps, composed of 80 neoplastic and 27 non-neoplastic polyps, were evaluated. OBI clearly showed the capillary network of the surface mucosa of neoplastic polyps at low magnification, whereas the surface mucosa of non-neoplastic polyps showed up as a pale lesion. The capillary pattern in conventional colonoscopy had 74% accuracy, 71% sensitivity, and 81% specificity for neoplastic polyps. The accuracy and sensitivity were significantly lower than those that used the capillary pattern in OBI (accuracy 87% and sensitivity 93%) and the pit pattern in chromoendoscopy (accuracy 86% and sensitivity 90%). There were no significant differences in specificity (OBI 70% and chromoendoscopy 74%). The kappa analysis indicated good agreement in both OBI and chromoendoscopy.
Conclusions
Capillary-pattern diagnosis in OBI is superior to that in conventional endoscopy and is not significantly different from pit-pattern diagnosis for predicting the histology of small colorectal polyps.}
